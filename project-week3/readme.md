# IWS Project Week 3

## Summary:

For this week we have successfully implementated the HTML page rendering from the Flask server code. Additionally, we have accomplished the BMI calculation functionality, presenting the results on the user interface through inputs such as height, weight, age, and gender. Furthermore, we have contributed to the development of a dedicated page enabling users to input their preferred food items and exercises for improved health. The DietFit app now features a user-friendly interface for efficient health and fitness tracking.

Significant improvements encompass the introduction of new server routes for seamless HTML file rendering, elevating the overall user experience. Noteworthy updates involve the creation of three primary pages (`home, user details, login`), HTML rendering from the Flask server, and the integration of a real-time BMI calculator. Additionally, a supplementary page facilitates user input for food and exercise preferences. The default route has been configured to serve as the landing page by rendering the `home.html` template when accessed via the browser (`http://localhost:9000/`). The DietFit app now incorporates an API call function triggered by the `Calculate BMI` button, initiating a request to the `calculate_bmi` route in the Flask server. This facilitates seamless interaction and dynamic BMI calculations based on user input.
