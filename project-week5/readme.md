# IWS Project Week 5

## Summary:

I feel happy in accomplishing the storage of diverse food item data and workout details in MongoDB. Additionally, We implemented a signup and login system, allowing users to access our application. The logic for creating and validating user data in MongoDB during login has been successfully integrated. We've also introduced an Exercise Plan feature, similar to the Diet Plan, based on user information. Upon accessing the application, users can specify their culinary preferences, dietary requirements, any food allergies, and preferred exercisesâ€”ranging from cardio workouts to soothing yoga sessions. Utilizing this input alongside Body Mass Index (BMI), Diet-Fit dynamically generates a well-organized 30-day diet and exercise plan presented in a table format.

To enhance user experience, I've revised the installation steps in the readme file, specifically addressing the MongoDB installation process.
