# Summary:

In this project, for the first week I have worked on implementing a flask server for the "Diet Fit" application that offers two main functionalities: BMI calculation and estimating average calorie intake. The application is designed to assist users in maintaining a healthy diet and understanding their nutritional needs.

The project directory(`~5130f2023/diet-fit`) structure includes the following key components:

1. `requirements.txt`: This file lists all the Python packages required for the application. These packages can be easily installed using the `pip install -r requirements.txt` command, ensuring that all necessary libraries are available.

2. `main.py`: This is the main application file containing the code for the Flask server. The server has two endpoints: `/calculate_bmi` for calculating the Body Mass Index (BMI) and `/calculate_calories` for estimating average calorie intake. Users can send their data to these endpoints through HTTP POST requests to receive the desired calculations.

3. To use this application, we need to have `python3` and `pip` installed on their system. Optionally, we can set up a virtual environment for better package management. The README(https://github.com/jkoleti-uml/5130f2023/blob/main/diet-fit/readme.md) provides detailed instructions on how to create a virtual environment, and install the required packages. After the installation is complete, we can start the Flask server by running `main.py`, and it will be ready to accept requests at port `9000` for BMI and calorie intake calculations.

4. `ui` directory contains all the files which are required by the front-end.

This marks the first week of development, Akhil worked on the required HTML files for the application, I can proudly say that I have worked on the backend flask server and I feel that we've successfully implemented the basic functionality of our Diet Fit application, allowing users to calculate their BMI and estimate average calorie intake. As we move forward, we will add and enhance the features and capabilities of the application in the coming weeks.
