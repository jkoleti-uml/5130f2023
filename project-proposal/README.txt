'DietFit' is an user-friendly web application, aimed at promoting a healthier lifestyle. 
Users provide their height, weight, age, and gender, and in response, the application 
calculates their BMI (Body Mass Index) and establishes the recommended daily calorie 
intake. But DietFit doesn't stop there; it takes a more comprehensive approach. It 
seeks to understand the user's culinary preferences, such as whether they favour 
Indian, Mexican, or other cuisines, and whether their dietary choices lean toward 
vegetarian, non-vegetarian, or vegan options. Additionally, it takes into account 
any food allergies the user may have for their safety. On the physical activity front, 
DietFit inquires about preferred exercises, like cardio workouts, badminton, calming 
yoga sessions, and more. Once all the necessary information is gathered, DietFit 
crafts a personalised diet and activity plan specific to each user.
