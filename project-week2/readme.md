# IWS Project Week 2

## Summary:

The DietFit app now added user authentication and MongoDB integration for enhanced functionality. Flask-Login manages user sessions, ensuring secure login and logout experiences. The app interacts with MongoDB using Flask-PyMongo, allowing seamless storage and retrieval of user data. To get started, install the required packages (`Flask`, `Flask-PyMongo`, `Flask-Login`) with `pip install Flask Flask-PyMongo Flask-Login`. Set a secure `SECRET_KEY` in the app configuration. The app introduces new authentication routes, allowing users to log in and log out securely. Protected routes ensure that only authenticated users can access certain functionalities. Existing features, such as BMI calculation and calorie intake recommendations, remain intact. Users can seamlessly navigate through these features while benefiting from the added security and data management capabilities. Ensure that MongoDB is running locally on the default port (27017) to leverage the full functionality of the app. Explore the possibilities of DietFit with these updates, providing a more comprehensive and secure user experience. These are the backend updates for this week.
