# IWS Project Week 4

## Summary:

For this week we have successfully implementated the HTML page rendering the dietplan HTML file. I'm really proud that I figured out how to calculate the calories the user need based on user's BMI. We also worked on adding a new page where the user can tell us more about favorite foods, any allergies the user might have, and the exercises user like. Using the info given, we show the user a personalized diet and exercise plan in a simple table. Diet-Fit wiil be user's personalized health buddy! When the user opens the app, he/she can tell us about their favorite foods, dietary choices, allergies, and the exercises they enjoy, like cardio or yoga. Diet-Fit uses this, along with the user's BMI, to create a 30-day diet plan shown in an easy-to-follow table. The plan considers different types of foods, dietary needs, and exercises, gives a complete approach to staying healthy. The cool stuff includes calculating calories based on the user's BMI and keeping their experience updated. On the technical side of things, we made sure the server (using Flask) can calculate calories based on BMI and show new pages correctly.
